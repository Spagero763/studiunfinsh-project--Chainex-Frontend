## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to represent the advanced technology and secure environment of blockchain transactions.
- Background color: Very light purple (#F3E5F5), offering a gentle contrast with the primary color and ensuring readability.
- Accent color: Royal blue (#3F51B5), selected for buttons and interactive elements to attract user attention and signify trustworthiness.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font offering a modern, machined, objective, neutral look that is suitable for a tech-oriented interface.
- Use flat, vector-based icons for a clean, modern aesthetic. Icons should be primarily in the primary color (deep purple) with the accent color (royal blue) used for highlights.
- Utilize a grid-based layout with generous padding and whitespace to maintain a clutter-free and user-friendly interface. Employ responsive design principles to ensure optimal viewing on various devices.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience. For example, animate token value changes on the staking panel or during token swaps, providing feedback without being distracting.
